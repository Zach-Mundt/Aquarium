## How to Use

To play just download Aquarium.apk onto your Oculus Quest 1 or 2. For the full Unity build you will have to download the repository and run it through Unity Hub.

## Controls 

Movement:
  -All movement is done with the right-hand joystick. Velocity is added based on how far forward or back you push the joystick. Your character will move in the direction that your hand is pointing, not the direction you are necessiarily looking.
  -In order to stop instantly just press down the right joystick.
Menu System:
  -In order to add objects from the menu use your right hand controller, aim it at the object you would like to add, then pull the trigger. The button will flash if selected.
  -You may add as many objects to the scene as you would like.
World-in-Miniature:
  -When you start the table in-front of you is where all minitures will be created.
  -They can be grabbed and moved around using the right hand controller.
  -The left hand joystick will resize anything the user is holding by pressing it forward or backwards.
  -Objects can be removed by placing them in the trashcan that is to the left of the table. It is the gray cylinder.
